# Evan's Note

This is a website I worked on during my time volunteering with DevProgress, a pro-Democratic Party volunteer coding organization, during the 2016 Presidential campaign. I was about three weeks into my coursework at Bloc when I started working on this, and I had never worked on a professionally built website before. Thus, the vast majority of the content was created by other people, and my contributions amount to a few CSS adjustments and a few image edits.

Although I was only an inexperienced member of a large team, I learned many valuable lessons while working with DevProgress. First and foremost, I learned how to fork a Git repository, make my own changes, and submit pull requests.  Furthermore, I had been a lifelong Windows user up until my time volunteering for DevProgess, and it was during my time volunteering that I decided to finally make the switch to Zorin OS, an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution designed to incoporate the best features of Windows into the Linux environment.

This project gave me some invaluable practical experience working in a professional setting with a web development team for the first time. Even though we all know how that election went, I remain proud that I put in this effort to support Hillary Clinton's candidacy.

What follows is the official readme for the project.
